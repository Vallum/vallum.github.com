## Lectures

* Khan Academy, Linear Albebra
  - good introduction, but cannot finish Linear Algebra by this alone.

* Essense of Linear Algebra, 3Blue1Brown
  - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab
  - good intuitive
  
* Linear Algebra - MIT OCW, Gilbert Strang (2008)
  - I prefer the Linear Algebra lectures parts included in 2015's differential equaltions and linear algebra lectures.
